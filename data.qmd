# Data


This project draws on three primary U.S. federal data sources: the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics (CES), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) via the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. All datasets are obtained directly from official sources, in compliance with project guidelines.


## Description


**1. U.S. Census Bureau — American Community Survey (ACS)**

The ACS provides nationally representative, annually updated demographic and socioeconomic statistics. All ACS data used in this project come from the ACS 1-year estimates, accessed through the tidycensus R package, which retrieves data directly from the Census API.

Remote Work Data

To measure remote-work prevalence, I use the ACS table:

* B08006 — Workers by Means of Transportation to Work

* B08006_001: Total workers

* B08006_017: Worked from home

Remote-work percentages are computed for 2019 and 2022 to quantify changes during the COVID-19 period.

Migration Data

To analyze mobility patterns, I use:

* B07001 — Geographical Mobility in the Past Year

* B07001_004: Lived in the same house one year ago

* B07001_007: Moved from a different county

* B07001_010: Moved from a different state


**2. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics — Current Employment Statistics (CES)**

Employment trends by industry are obtained directly from the BLS CES “All Employees, Thousands” dataset.

Instead of relying on third-party processed files, employment data are loaded from the official BLS data release: ce.data.0.AllCESSeries.txt — containing monthly employment counts for all CES series.

Selected industry series include:

* Total Nonfarm (CES0000000001)

* Construction (CES2000000001)

* Manufacturing (CES3000000001)

* Financial Services (CES5500000001)

* Education & Health Services (CES6500000001)

* Leisure & Hospitality (CES7000000001)

* Government (CES9000000001)

* Information Technology (CES5000000001)

* Other Services (CES8000000001)

* Mining & Logging (CES1000000001)

These series support analysis of pandemic-related employment shocks and sector-specific recovery trajectories.


**3. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) via FRED**

To assess travel behavior, I use the FHWA’s national Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) series, accessed through the fredr R package: TRFVOLUSM227NFWA — Total Vehicle Miles Traveled (Millions).

Although hosted on FRED, this series originates from the FHWA’s Travel Monitoring Analysis System (TMAS). The dataset provides monthly national VMT back to the 1970s and enables visualization of pandemic-driven mobility declines and seasonality.
