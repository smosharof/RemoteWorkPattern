    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic triggered one of the most rapid shifts in work arrangements in modern U.S. history, forcing millions of workers into remote or hybrid roles almost overnight. This shift reshaped not only employment patterns, but also commuting behavior, residential migration, and broader economic activity. As remote work stabilized into a permanent fixture for many industries, questions emerged about which regions and sectors experienced the greatest change, how travel and mobility responded, and whether the flexibility to work from home contributed to new patterns of moving within or across state lines.\nThis project explores these themes using federal data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. By combining measures of remote-work adoption, migration flows, industry-level employment trends, and vehicle-miles traveled, the analysis examines how different parts of the country were affected and how behavior changed before, during, and after the pandemic. The goal is to identify meaningful patterns—across states, across industries, and across time—that reveal how remote work has reshaped the geographic and economic landscape of the United States.\nWe address four questions:\n\nHow did remote-work adoption vary by region?\nWere there any noticeable patterns between COVID-19 related local restrictions and remote-work adoption?\nDid people drive more or less during COVID-19 and immediately after?\nAre there links between remote-work adoption and residential migration?",

    "text": "This project draws on four primary U.S. and international data sources: the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics (CES), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) via the FRED API, and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). All datasets are retrieved directly from their official providers or APIs in compliance with project guidelines.\n1. U.S. Census Bureau — American Community Survey (ACS)\nThe ACS provides nationally representative, annually updated demographic and socioeconomic statistics. All ACS data used in this project come from the ACS 1-year estimates and were accessed through the tidycensus R package, which retrieves data via the Census API. To measure remote-work prevalence, I use ACS table B08006, which reports workers by means of transportation to work. The variables B08006_001 (total workers) and B08006_017 (worked from home) are used to compute remote-work percentages for 2019 and 2022, enabling analysis of pandemic-period changes. To evaluate residential mobility, I use ACS table B07001, which reports geographical mobility in the past year. Specifically, B07001_004 identifies individuals living in the same house one year ago, B07001_007 captures moves from a different county, and B07001_010 captures moves from a different state. These measures support assessment of migration patterns and their relationship to remote-work prevalence.\n2. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics — Current Employment Statistics (CES)\nEmployment trends by industry are taken from the BLS CES program, using the official monthly data file ce.data.0.AllCESSeries.txt. This dataset includes employment counts for all CES series and allows construction of sector-level time series. Industries examined in this project include Total Nonfarm, Construction, Manufacturing, Financial Services, Education and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, Information Technology, Other Services, and Mining and Logging. These data provide context for understanding how employment shocks and recoveries during COVID-19 varied across sectors that differ in remote-work feasibility.\n3. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) via FRED\nTo assess national travel patterns, the project uses the FHWA’s Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) series, accessed through the fredr R package. Although hosted by the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) system, this series originates from the FHWA’s Travel Monitoring Analysis System. The dataset includes monthly VMT totals extending back several decades and enables visualization of both pandemic-related mobility declines and seasonal travel behavior.\n4. Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)\nTo incorporate state-level pandemic policy context, the project uses the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. The OxCGRT dataset compiles daily indicators of government interventions, including stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, gathering restrictions, and other public-health policies. After downloading the U.S. state dataset from the OxCGRT GitHub repository, I compute the average 2020 Stringency Index for each state. This summary measure provides a standardized way to compare levels of policy strictness across states and to examine whether stricter COVID-19 regulations are associated with greater increases in remote-work adoption.",

While many Southern and Midwestern states saw smaller increases, Washington, Maryland, Virginia, and District of Columbia saw the largest jumps. One curious fact about District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia is that many federal employees live in those states due to close proximity to the federal offices such as Capitol Hill or Pentagon. This may be an indicator that the U.S. Government was one of the largest adopters of the remote work during that period.\n\n\n3.0.2 Plot 2 - Impact of Local stringency at the height of Covid (2020)\nSource: Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/tree/master\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load clean policy data\npolicy &lt;- read_csv(\n  \"/Users/a348092/Documents/Mshamim_Docs/Continuing Education/EDAV/RemoteWorkPattern/policy_state_clean.csv\",\n  show_col_types = FALSE\n)\n\n# States to highlight\nhighlight_states &lt;- c(\n  \"District Of Columbia\",\n  \"Washington\",\n  \"Maryland\",\n  \"Massachusetts\",\n  \"Virginia\"\n)\n\n# Prepare data\npolicy_bar &lt;- policy %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    state = str_to_title(region)   # Clean labels\n  ) %&gt;%\n\n  arrange(stringency_2020)\n\n# Base plot\nggplot(policy_bar, aes(x = reorder(state, stringency_2020),\n                       y = stringency_2020,\n                       fill = stringency_2020)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"navy\") +\n  \n  # Highlighted labels for the selected states\n  geom_text(\n    data = policy_bar %&gt;% filter(state %in% highlight_states),\n    aes(label = state),\n    color = \"black\",\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"COVID-19 Stringency Index by State (2020)\",\n    subtitle = \"Bold labels highlight top remote-work growth states\",\n    x = \"State\",\n    y = \"Stringency Index (Oxford)\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title  = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe plot shows how strict each state’s COVID-19 policies were in 2020, with darker bars representing stronger restrictions. States like Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas had among the highest average stringency, while Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas were among the lowest. The highlighted states—Washington, Massachusetts, Virginia, Maryland, and D.C.—experienced major remote-work growth, yet they vary widely in policy strictness, suggesting that strong remote-work adoption wasn’t driven solely by how strict a state’s COVID-19 measures were.\n\n\n3.0.3 Plot 3 - Remote Work Share by State\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(choroplethr)\n\n# Step 1: Prepare ACS data in the required format\ndf_remote &lt;- acs_remote_2022 %&gt;%\n  transmute(\n    region = tolower(NAME),         # match choroplethr naming\n    value = remote_pct_2022         # renamed to \"value\"\n  )\n\n# Step 2: Draw the map using state_choropleth\nstate_choropleth(df_remote,\n                 title  = \"Remote Work Share by State (ACS 2022)\",\n                 legend = \"% Working from Home\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nThe map shows large geographic variation in remote-work adoption in 2022. States on the West Coast (WA, OR, CA), Mountain West (CO, UT), and the Northeast (MA, MD, VA, DC) have the highest work-from-home rates. Much of the South and Midwest remain lower. The pattern suggests remote work is most prevalent in regions with strong tech, professional services, and knowledge-economy labor markets.\n\n\n3.0.4 Plot 4 - Employment Drop and Recovery During COVID-19\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Step 1: Load CES data\nbls_raw &lt;- read_tsv(\n  \"/Users/a348092/Documents/Mshamim_Docs/Continuing Education/EDAV/RemoteWorkPattern/ce.data.0.AllCESSeries.txt\",\n  col_names = c(\"series_id\",\"year\",\"period\",\"value\",\"footnote\"),\n  skip = 1\n)\n\n# Step 2: Updated industries (P&B Services removed, Other Services added)\nindustries &lt;- tibble(\n  series_id = c(\n    \"CES1000000001\",  # Mining & Logging\n    \"CES2000000001\",  # Construction\n    \"CES3000000001\",  # Manufacturing\n    \"CES5000000001\",  # Information Technology\n    \"CES5500000001\",  # Financial Services\n    \"CES6500000001\",  # Education & Health Services\n    \"CES7000000001\",  # Leisure & Hospitality\n    \"CES9000000001\",  # Government\n    \"CES8000000001\"   # Other Services\n  ),\n  label = c(\n    \"Mining & Logging\",\n    \"Construction\",\n    \"Manufacturing\",\n    \"Information Technology\",\n    \"Financial Services\",\n    \"Education & Health Services\",\n    \"Leisure & Hospitality\",\n    \"Government\",\n    \"Other Services\"\n  )\n)\n\n# Step 3: Filter dataset to selected industries\ndf_bls &lt;- bls_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(series_id %in% industries$series_id,\n         period != \"M13\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    month = as.integer(substr(period, 2, 3)),\n    date = as.Date(paste(year, month, \"1\"), \"%Y %m %d\"),\n    value = as.numeric(value)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  left_join(industries, by = \"series_id\")\n\n# Step 4: Zoom into 2018–2024 (COVID focus)\ndf_zoom &lt;- df_bls %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2018-01-01\"))\n\n# Step 5: COVID shock plot with fixed y-axis\nggplot(df_zoom, aes(date, value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 0.9) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date(\"2020-03-01\"),\n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", linewidth = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~ label, scales = \"fixed\", ncol = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Employment Drop and Recovery During COVID-19\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Employment (Thousands)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 9),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 11, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nThe plot shows how COVID-19 affected employment across major U.S. industries. Leisure & Hospitality experienced the steepest collapse, while Construction, Government, Financial Services, and IT saw milder declines. Most sectors recovered gradually after 2020, but the size and speed of recovery varied, revealing uneven pandemic impacts across the labor market.\n\n\n3.0.5 Plot 5 - Seasonal Heatmap of Monthly Vehicle Miles Traveled\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Load FRED key once (if not already done)\nlibrary(fredr)\nfredr_set_key(Sys.getenv(\"FRED_API_KEY\"))\n\n# Get FHWA Vehicle Miles Traveled data from FRED\nvmt &lt;- fredr(\n  series_id = \"TRFVOLUSM227NFWA\",  # FHWA total vehicle miles\n  observation_start = as.Date(\"2018-01-01\")\n)\n\n# Step 1: Prepare VMT data\nvmt_heat &lt;- vmt %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Year = year(date),\n    Month = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Step 2: Plot heatmap\nggplot(vmt_heat, aes(x = Month, y = factor(Year), fill = value)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    option = \"plasma\",\n    name = \"Vehicle Miles\\n(Billions)\",\n    direction = -1\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Seasonal Heatmap of Monthly Vehicle Miles Traveled\",\n    subtitle = \"FHWA Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) via FRED\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Year\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nThe heatmap shows strong seasonal patterns in U.S. vehicle travel, with higher volumes in summer and lower in winter. A dramatic collapse appears in April 2020 during COVID lockdowns, followed by gradual recovery. Recent years show a return to typical seasonal rhythms, though not always matching pre-pandemic peaks.\n\n\n3.0.6 Plot 6 - Remote Work vs. Interstate Migration (2022, by State)\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\n\n# Silence ACS messages\noptions(tidycensus.quiet = TRUE)\n\n# -------------------------------\n# 1.

Most states cluster between 5–6% interstate movers regardless of remote-work prevalence, suggesting only a weak relationship. Outliers exist—such as a high remote-work state with typical migration levels—but overall, remote work does not appear to strongly drive cross-state relocation in 2022.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The data show that remote work increased substantially nationwide between 2019 and 2022, but the rise was uneven across states. Regions with strong tech and professional sectors experienced the largest gains, while much of the South and Midwest saw more modest growth. Employment patterns also shifted unevenly, with Leisure & Hospitality experiencing the deepest job losses during the pandemic and slower recovery, while sectors like Finance, IT, and Government rebounded more quickly. Mobility data reveal a sharp but temporary collapse in travel during early 2020, followed by a return to normal seasonal patterns. Migration analysis suggests only a weak connection between remote-work adoption and interstate movement. Overall, the pandemic reshaped work, mobility, and industry activity in distinct ways, with remote work emerging as an important—but not singular—driver of post-pandemic geographic and economic change.",
