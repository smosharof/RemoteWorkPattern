    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic triggered one of the most rapid shifts in work arrangements in modern U.S. history, forcing millions of workers into remote or hybrid roles almost overnight. This shift reshaped not only employment patterns, but also commuting behavior, residential migration, and broader economic activity. As remote work stabilized into a permanent fixture for many industries, questions emerged about which regions and sectors experienced the greatest change, how travel and mobility responded, and whether the flexibility to work from home contributed to new patterns of moving within or across state lines.\nThis project explores these themes using federal data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). By combining measures of remote-work adoption, migration flows, industry-level employment trends, and vehicle-miles traveled, the analysis examines how different parts of the country were affected and how behavior changed before, during, and after the pandemic. The goal is to identify meaningful patterns—across states, across industries, and across time—that reveal how remote work has reshaped the geographic and economic landscape of the United States.\nWe address three questions:\n\nHow did remote-work vary by region and industry after COVID-19?\nHow has commuting time, public transport usage, or road traffic changed?\nAre there links between remote-work adoption and residential migration?",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project draws on three primary U.S. federal data sources: the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics (CES), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) via the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. All datasets are obtained directly from official sources, in compliance with project guidelines.\n1. U.S. Census Bureau — American Community Survey (ACS)\nThe ACS provides nationally representative, annually updated demographic and socioeconomic statistics. All ACS data used in this project come from the ACS 1-year estimates, accessed through the tidycensus R package, which retrieves data directly from the Census API.\nRemote Work Data\nTo measure remote-work prevalence, I use the ACS table:\nRemote-work percentages are computed for 2019 and 2022 to quantify changes during the COVID-19 period.\nMigration Data\nTo analyze mobility patterns, I use:\n2. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics — Current Employment Statistics (CES)\nEmployment trends by industry are obtained directly from the BLS CES “All Employees, Thousands” dataset.\nInstead of relying on third-party processed files, employment data are loaded from the official BLS data release: ce.data.0.AllCESSeries.txt — containing monthly employment counts for all CES series.\nSelected industry series include:\nThese series support analysis of pandemic-related employment shocks and sector-specific recovery trajectories.\n3. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) via FRED\nTo assess travel behavior, I use the FHWA’s national Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) series, accessed through the fredr R package: TRFVOLUSM227NFWA — Total Vehicle Miles Traveled (Millions).\nAlthough hosted on FRED, this series originates from the FHWA’s Travel Monitoring Analysis System (TMAS). The dataset provides monthly national VMT back to the 1970s and enables visualization of pandemic-driven mobility declines and seasonality.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The data show that remote work increased substantially nationwide between 2019 and 2022, but the rise was uneven across states. Regions with strong tech and professional sectors experienced the largest gains, while much of the South and Midwest saw more modest growth. Employment patterns also shifted unevenly, with Leisure & Hospitality experiencing the deepest job losses during the pandemic and slower recovery, while sectors like Finance, IT, and Government rebounded more quickly. Mobility data reveal a sharp but temporary collapse in travel during early 2020, followed by a return to normal seasonal patterns. Migration analysis suggests only a weak connection between remote-work adoption and interstate movement. Overall, the pandemic reshaped work, mobility, and industry activity in distinct ways, with remote work emerging as an important—but not singular—driver of post-pandemic geographic and economic change.",
